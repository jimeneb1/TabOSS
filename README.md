# TabOSS
Repository for the Tab OSS project

Update 12/16/16: The Updated project now implements the MyTab Activity, allowing returning users to access previously caluclated data.

The TabOSS project provides innovation in solving the issues associated with splitting a bill/check when eating out at a restaurant. By granting users with full control over the calculations, they are able to use the application specifically to their situation. The ease of use of the system provides users with a great experience which may lead them to use the app again when they go out to eat next. This application can prove to be very useful for people who frequently go out to social eating events, whether they be professional or casual.
